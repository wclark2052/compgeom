This is a computational geometry library written in Ruby. The rb file contains the functions and classes that comprise the library, as well as a test script that can be run by invoking the file from the terminal.

The test script requires one argument, which is the name of the XML file containing "shape" data which the script will evaluate. The "shape" data is a set of <shape> tags, each including <point> elements to define an ordinal set of points.

There is a sample XML file to run this script, also included  in the repository. Feel free to edit it to your liking, for fresh tests.

Hpricot is required to run the rb file.
